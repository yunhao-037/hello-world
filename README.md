# hello-world
Yunhao's first GitHub repo! :)

Yunhao here. I've learned Python sometime ago, and just got my hands on ROS.

Interested in developing a project / app for financial spending logs.
ROS is fun too! Intended to learn and practice it on my own for the first few years after graduation.

Thinking about learning some new coding languages in the future...
